Kafka Connect Transforms Library for Jefferson Lab

At this time there is only a single transform: EpicsToAlarm, which is used to transform messages produced by [epics2kafka](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2kafka) to a format that matches the [kafka-alarm-system](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/kafka-alarm-system).
